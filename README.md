# Predicting Credit Card Default Using Machine Learning
Predicting Credit Card Default Using Machine Learning 

Credit card default prediction is a critical task in the financial sector, enabling institutions to proactively manage credit risk, optimize lending strategies, and reduce financial losses. In this project, we explore the application of machine learning techniques to predict whether a credit card client is likely to default on their next payment. We use the “Default of Credit Card Clients” dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains detailed financial and demographic information of 30,000 clients. This dataset originates from research published in Expert Systems with Applications (DOI: 10.1016/j.eswa.2007.12.02), providing a reliable basis for academic and practical analysis.

This project workflow involves rigorous data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature engineering, one-hot encoding of categorical variables, and scaling of numerical features. We then implement a range of supervised learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoost to develop predictive models. Each algorithm is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Collaboration is managed using GitHub for version control and Google Colab for cloud-based experimentation and model development. By comparing multiple algorithms, this study aims to determine the most effective approach for predicting defaults while emphasizing model interpretability, generalization, and the bias-variance trade-off. The insights gained from this project have potential applications in credit scoring systems and financial decision-making processes used by banks and lending institutions.
